I was brought in to redesign their website and create a digital style guide to be rolled out across all their digital channels.</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://www.freddiesflowers.com" target="_blank">live site</a>.</p></div><div class="mockup-hero mockup-white-ff-homepage"></div><div class="textbox"><h3>Research</h3><p>Freddie’s had been running for about four years before I got there so there was a fair amount of data to get my teeth into.</p><p>I also interviewed members of the customer service team to understand problems users were experiencing and set up an additional abandon basket email with a quick survey to get more information on why people were reluctant to sign up.</p></div><div class="mockup-hero mockup-white-ff-landingpages"></div><div class="textbox"><h3>User Journeys</h3><p>Armed with an understanding of the audience and some of the problems they were experiencing, I created an exhaustive list of user goals and drew up ideal user journeys for them.</p></div><div class="mockup-hero mockup-white-ff-deliveryschedule"></div><div class="textbox"><h3>Wireframes</h3><p>With the user journeys in place I started wireframing and created a fully interactive prototype in Axure. This was particularly useful for the checkout and account pages as there were a lot of complicated user interactions to do with managing your delivery schedule and wider account.</p></div><div class="mockup-hero mockup-white-ff-wireframes"></div><div class="textbox"><h3>Design Style</h3><p>The existing website featured a lot of skeuomorphism and illustration – and while I wanted to keep a nod to this as it’s an important part of the wider branding – users needed to see the flowers. So I leant a lot more into photography and video.</p></div><div class="mockup-hero mockup-white-ff-recentdeliveries"></div><div class="textbox"><h3>Checkout &amp; Account Pages</h3><p>These pages needed to be, above all, simple to use. The hard part of selling the product was done at this stage in the user journey, so I relied on a minimalist style and spacious layouts with the occasional texture or illustration where appropriate to keep the pages as distraction-free as possible.</p></div><div class="mockup-hero mockup-white-ff-checkout"></div><div class="textbox"><h3>Style Guides</h3><p>With the UI of a few key pages signed off I created a Style Guide for the developers, the existing team and any future designers, and then rolled the design out to a few of the more complicated pages.</p></div><div class="mockup-hero mockup-white-ff-styleguide"></div><div class="textbox bottom"><p>Using the now established digital style guides I created a series of ad templates to use on social media which resulted in an almost 20% increase in visitors.</p><p>And despite this increase in traffic we saw a 14% increase in the conversion rate, an order rate increase of 8% and almost double the number of friend referrals.</p></div></div></div></div><script src="/js/chunk-vendors.f7297daa.js"></script><script src="/js/app.e0dc9b88.js"></script><script src="/js/chunk-vendors.d8651c74.js"></script><script src="/js/app.fe592a1e.js"></script></body></html>
